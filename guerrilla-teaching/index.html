        Guerrilla Teaching is a revolution.  Not a flag-waving, drum-beating revolution, but an underground revolution.  It’s not about changing policy or influencing government; it’s about doing what you know to be right, regardless of what you’re told.  It’s a book its author never meant to write, but it was just too important not to.

              "Guerrilla Teaching is a great, practical and inspirational book for any teacher at any point in their career. It’s refreshing to find a book that offers support and advice that will actually make a difference to the way the children we teach learn and enjoy school. It’s a book that reminds us to consider the type of people we want our children to grow up to be and how to help them achieve that.  It reminded me why I choose teaching as a career."
