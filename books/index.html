        ‘The Monkey-Proof Box: Curriculum design for building knowledge, developing creative thinking and promoting independence’ is a manifesto on how to dismantle the curriculum we’re told to deliver and construct in its place the curriculum we need to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing on his ground-breaking work as an inner-city primary school teacher, Jonathan Lear sets out how teachers and leaders can deliver a curriculum rich in authentic learning experiences that help children learn from one another and grow into empowered, knowledgeable and creative thinkers who are driven by insatiable curiosity.

        <h2>Guerrilla Teaching</h2>
        <p>
          To find out what’s going on with all the gorillas, take a look at Jonathan’s first book ‘Guerrilla Teaching’ – it’s full of the kind of ideas, thinking and practical advice that’ll ensure our children get the education they deserve regardless of what we’re told.

        Guerrilla Teaching is a revolution.  Not a flag-waving, drum-beating revolution, but an underground revolution.  It’s not about changing policy or influencing government; it’s about doing what you know to be right, regardless of what you’re told.  It’s a book its author never meant to write, but it was just too important not to.

It’s refreshing to find a book that offers support and advice that will actually make a difference to the way the children we teach learn and enjoy school. It’s a book that reminds us to consider the type of people we want our children to grow up to be and how to help them achieve that.  It reminded me why I choose teaching as a career."
