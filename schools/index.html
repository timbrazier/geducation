        Each term is themed, and contains topics that allow teachers the opportunity to design relevant, engaging, creative and authentic learning experiences for their children.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Guerrilla Curriculum offers a broad and balanced approach to primary education, giving children the opportunity and space to develop a genuine depth of knowledge whilst also allowing them to develop the skills they need as 21st century learners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Guerrilla Curriculum comes fully supported with a range of resources, including training materials, planning documents and skills progression grids.

        "The Guerrilla Curriculum is the most complete and well-rounded curriculum model I have seen.  It has provided us with the opportunity to create   purposeful and exciting learning that is very much our own.  Jonathan worked with the entire staff to develop units of work that have given us a curriculum that we are confident in delivering. It has a well thought out structure and content that is engaging and exciting for both pupils and teachers.  The skills progression grids have allowed staff the freedom to plan imaginative and authentic units of work that are backed up by rigorous curriculum coverage.  The outcomes of the Guerrilla curriculum have completely transformed the learning in our school - our children are genuinely excited by their learning and can’t wait to find out what their next project will be."
